# Python - Game - Hangman

`Hangman` is a classic word game in which you must guess the secret word one letter at a time. This version is a simple console game, made by using python programming language for my learning purpose. My main focus of this project is to understand some basics of python programming language as a beginner.

# Features
  - You have to guess a word to save a man.
  - Each correctly guessed letter is added to the word.
  - Every wrong guessing will gradually drag the man to the death
  - After all turns, if you can't guess the whole word, the man will die.
